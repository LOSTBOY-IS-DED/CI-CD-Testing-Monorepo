Docker files becomes bit tricky is the application needs to
the database during the build phase 

study about build args and build cache ???

the problem is next app is that when it builds it creates 
a static page which wont talk to the db if any data changed 

There are two ways to solve this 

1. export const revalidate = 60 // revalidate every 60 seconds
or
2. export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

the first way is best of both worlds

if the db is down 
1. websockets builds  --> will run with issues
2. backend builds
3. but not the frontend


build command will run the file take to the database get back with some data and create a HTML with it ..
eventually this will run on docker production 
when we are deploying to the production every day on every commit we need to 
build the docker file and push it to the docker hun


dumbest approach 
1. add DATABASE_URL while building to the dockerfile every can see it and you are screwed 
like this 
RUN DATABASE_URL="<db:password>" bun run build

or we can pass dynamic env variables
